## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS

### High Priority Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

#### 🔴 Core API Development Stalled
- **[CU-86dy6a841: Build water quality API Endpoint](https://app.clickup.com/t/86dy6a841)** ⚠️
  - **Status**: Backlog (no progress in 48+ hours)
  - **Description**: Create endpoint to ingest sensor data; includes unit tests and swagger docs
  - **Risk Level**: **CRITICAL** - Core API functionality not started
  - **Impact**: Blocks all downstream development and sensor data integration
  - **Business Impact**: Cannot process water quality data from sensors

#### 🟡 Infrastructure Setup Delayed
- **[CU-86dy6d5h4: API Branch](https://app.clickup.com/t/86dy6d5h4)** ⚠️
  - **Status**: Backlog (no progress since creation)
  - **Description**: API branch infrastructure setup
  - **Impact**: Development environment not properly configured
  - **Dependency**: Required before API endpoint development can begin

### 🟢 Tasks Making Progress
- **[CU-86dy6d904: Test Development Task](https://app.clickup.com/t/86dy6d904)** ✅
  - **Status**: In Development (High Priority)
  - **Assignee**: Robert
  - **Due Date**: November 1, 2025
  - **Progress**: Active development in progress
  - **Priority**: High (🟠)

## 🎯 ACTION ITEMS FOR PRODUCT MANAGER

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)
1. **🔥 Move CU-86dy6a841 to "In Development"** - Critical water quality API endpoint has been in backlog too long and blocks core functionality
2. **👥 Assign developer resources to CU-86dy6d5h4** - API branch setup task needs immediate attention to establish development infrastructure  
3. **📈 Review development velocity** - Only 1 of 3 tasks actively progressing; consider resource allocation or task prioritization

### Strategic Considerations
- **Development Bottleneck**: Core API functionality is the critical path for all AquaFlow features
- **Resource Allocation**: Current team capacity may be insufficient for project timeline
- **Risk Mitigation**: Establish backup plans for API development if current approach faces delays
