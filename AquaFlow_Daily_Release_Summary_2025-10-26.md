## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS

### High Priority Issues
- **[CU-86dy6a841: Build water quality API Endpoint](https://app.clickup.com/t/86dy6a841)**
  - **Status**: Backlog ⚠️
  - **Duration**: No progress in 48+ hours
  - **Description**: Create endpoint to ingest sensor data; includes unit tests and swagger docs
  - **Risk Level**: **CRITICAL** - Core API functionality not yet started
  - **Impact**: Blocks all downstream development and sensor data integration

---

## 🎯 ACTION ITEMS FOR PRODUCT MANAGER

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)
1. **🔥 Priority 1**: Move water quality API endpoint task (CU-86dy6a841) from "backlog" to "in development" status
2. **👥 Resource Allocation**: Assign dedicated developer to CU-86dy6a841 to begin API endpoint implementation
3. **🏗️ Infrastructure Setup**: Initialize project structure and development environment for AquaFlow API development

### Strategic Considerations
- Repository is in initial state - development pipeline needs to be established
- Core API functionality is the foundation for all AquaFlow features
- Consider setting up CI/CD pipeline once development begins
